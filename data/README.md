To access the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Click on the following link to download the zip file: [Data Download Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZZhCf8YGDdpqr442tgjiynQY6rYL6DF8?usp=sharing).

2. After downloading the zip file, you'll need to unzip it, and you will obtain the folder named ``data``.

3. Move the "data" folder to the following path within your DeepMobility project directory: ``DeepMobility/DeepMobility/``.

Once the "data" folder is in the correct location, you should see the following file structure:
